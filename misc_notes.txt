HOW TO ADD TO PATH IN TERMINAL

    Run the following command:
        open ~/.bashrc
        OR open ~/.zshrc, depending on your terminal environment

    Add the following command at the end of the file
        export PATH="$PATH:<your path here>"

        e.g
        export PATH="$PATH:/Users/gailclifford/Applications/flutter/bin"
        As you can notice, we're concatenating to the path by doing: $PATH adding a colon and then adding our path

        export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.docker/bin"
        The above command takes the $HOME value which is a path itself, concatenates the location of docker and then
        concatenates it to the $PATH
        It would look like this: "$PATH:/Users/cliff/.docker/bin"
