HOW TO ADD TO PATH IN TERMINAL

    Run the following command:
        open ~/.bashrc
        OR open ~/.zshrc, depending on your terminal environment

    Add the following command at the end of the file
        export PATH="$PATH:<your path here>"

        e.g
        export PATH="$PATH:/Users/gailclifford/Applications/flutter/bin"
        As you can notice, we're concatenating to the path by doing: $PATH adding a colon and then adding our path

        export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.docker/bin"
        The above command takes the $HOME value which is a path itself, concatenates the location of docker and then
        concatenates it to the $PATH
        It would look like this: "$PATH:/Users/cliff/.docker/bin"

REFRESHING TERMINAL
    Do source ~/.zshrc OR source ~/.bashrc so that it can refresh any settings that you changed outside, e.g
    by editing zshrc or bashrc manually.


HOW TO SSH INTO A REMOTE LINUX MACHINE (e.g an EC2 instance)
cd into the directory containing the private key certificate
Change the privileges of the certificate file to read only
    chmod 400 certificate.cer

ssh into the instance
    ssh -i certificate.cer ubuntu@public_ip_address_here

Now you're in. You can run commands remotely. To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".


HOW TO EDIT A FILE IN TERMINAL
    Run this command: vim file_name

HOW TO RUN A BASH FILE

HOW TO ELEVATE A USER TO ALLOW THEM TO ACCESS A GROUP (e.g when running terminal commands)
    Scenario: the user ubuntu1 can't run any docker commands
    Solution: add them to the docker group
        sudo usermod -a -G docker <username>
        e.g sudo usermod -a -G docker ubuntu1
