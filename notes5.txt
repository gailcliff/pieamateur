-- CLASSES ---

CLASS AND INSTANCE VARIABLES
Instance variables are for data unique to each instance and class variables are for attributes and methods SHARED BY ALL INSTANCES of the class.
Class variables appear at the global scope of the class and instance variables are declared within the class functions (e.g __init__)

class Dog:
    kind = 'canine' # set class variable that will be shared by all instances

def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name # instance variable unique to each instance (each object instantiated from this class)

OPTIONS FOR CALLING A CLASS
1. Just apply parentheses directly
E.g
    dog = Dog('symba')
2. Use the __call__ method from 'type' which classes inherit from. Use 'ClassName.__call()'. Notice parentheses are only applied at the end of the statement
E.g
    dog = Dog.__call__('symba')

VARIABLES DECLARED AT THE GLOBAL SCOPE FOR THE CLASS ARE SHARED BY AND CAN BE ACCESSED BY ALL INSTANCES OF THE CLASS.
TO MAKE VARIABLES INSTANCE-SPECIFIC, YOU MUST DECLARE THEM AT THE CLASS FUNCTION LEVEL, PREFERABLY INSIDE __init__. DECLARE THEM INSIDE __init__ AND THEN ACCESS
THEM FROM ANYWHERE INSIDE THE CLASS.

Example of unintended outcome:
class Person:

    hobbies = []  # this will be shared by all instances
    age: int

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name


person = Person("john doe")
person.hobbies.append("skiing")
person.hobbies.append("travel")

person1 = Person("janet jane")
person1.hobbies.append("swimming")
person1.hobbies.append("archery")

print(person.hobbies)  # ['skiing', 'travel', 'swimming', 'archery']
print(person1.hobbies)  # ['skiing', 'travel', 'swimming', 'archery']

Both of the print calls above return a list containing variables that were not defined by either Person objects. Fix: move the declaration of 'hobbies' to __init__


INHERITANCE
Use super() to access parent attributes from within the child class. Analogous to 'super' in Java. Difference with Python is that you need to include the parentheses: super()


class Animal:

    name: str
    species: str

    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species

    def eat(self):
        print(self.name, " eating")

    def move(self):
        print(self.name, " moving")

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} of the species {self.species}"


class Dog(Animal):

    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name, "Dog")

    def eat(self):
        super().eat()
        print("Munch munch\n")

    def move(self):
        super().move()
        print("Sprint sprint\n")


animal = Animal("Whale", "Animalia")
animal.eat()
animal.move()
print(animal)

dog: Animal = Dog("Simba")
dog.eat()
dog.move()
print(dog)


Use isinstance() to check an instanceâ€™s type: isinstance(obj, int) will be True only if obj.__class__ is int or some class derived from int.
    first argument is object, second argument is the class
Use issubclass() to check class inheritance: issubclass(bool, int) is True since bool is a subclass of int. However, issubclass(float, int) is False since float is not a subclass of int
    both arguments (arg0 and arg1) are classes. you're checking if arg0 is a subclass of arg1


    print(isinstance(dog, Animal)) # True
    print(isinstance(animal, Dog)) # False
    print(issubclass(Dog, Animal)) # True
    print(issubclass(Animal, Dog)) # False

Private class variables: prefix your variable name with an underscore '_'. One underscore is fine.
For name-mangling, prefix your variable name with two underscores '__'. This will automatically change the name of the variable to a class specific-name
In the background. This is used to prevent naming conflicts/accidents, e.g in a class inheritance situation where you could possibly have such scenario.


DATA CLASS
A class that just holds some data and does nothing else.
Use the @dataclass annotation
This will also add things like a __string__() method etc.
You just declare the variable names and it handles the rest, including instantiation.

from dataclasses import dataclass
@dataclass
class Employee:
    name: str
    dept: str
    salary: int q

>>> john = Employee('john', 'computer lab', 1000)
>>> john.dept
'computer lab'
>>> john.salary
1000


CLASS METHODS
Class methods don't belong to any specific instance but to the class itself. Think of it like static methods in languages like Java,
but they're not static, they're...class methods.
Static methods usually can't modify or access any class-level attributes, but class methods can. You just invoke them not from
any specific instance, but through the class itself.

E.g:
class CustomModel(BaseModel):
    id: Optional[int] = None
    __schema_cls__: Type[db_models.DbModel] # use type hint to get editor support. this class variable's value will actually
                                            # be provided by the child classes

    @classmethod
    def fetch_all(cls): # cls is what self is for instance methods
        return list(cls.__schema_cls__.objects.all().values()) # you use it to access class variables


class User(CustomModel):
    user_name: str
    phone: str
    email: EmailStr
    __schema_cls__ = db_models.User # defining a member variable's value like this and not through 'self.variable_name'
                                    # makes this a class variable and thus all class instances will share it. this becomes
                                    # move evident if it's something like a list, and modifying the list makes all instances
                                    # of the same class have the same list elements (this may be unexpected if you didn't think it through).
                                    # if you actually do want a variable to be a class variable, you can access it through class methods
                                    # annotated with @classmethod


ITERATORS AND GENERATORS
Generators are a simple and powerful tool for CREATING ITERATORS. They are written like regular functions but use the yield statement whenever
they want to return data. Each time next() is called on it, the generator resumes where it left off (it remembers all the data values and which statement
was last executed). An example shows that generators can be trivially easy to create:

    def get_names(self):  # this is creating a generator. just use the 'yield' keyword instead of return
        for person_name in self.names:
            yield person_name

    # utilizing a generator
    for name in get_names(): # calling get_names() returns a generator
        print("nayme: ", name)

        OR
    Use the next() built-in method to access items sequentially in the iterator

    gen = get_names()
    next(gen) # get next item. the error StopIteration will be raised when the end of the iterator is reached.


Generator Expressions (used to create a generator (which is essentially a tool for creating iterators) using list-comprehension-like expressions)

#  generator expression. prefer generator expressions to list comprehensions because they're more memory efficient.
name_list = (name.upper() for name in person.names) # here's the generator expression. uses parentheses (), different from [] used in list comprehension
for name in name_list:
    print(name)


CREATING CUSTOM ITERATOR FROM YOUR CLASS

class Person:

    def __init__(self):
        self.names = []
        self.idx = 0

    def add_name(self, name):
        self.names.append(name)

    def __len__(self): # the dunder function __len__ is a proxy for getting the length of items in ths class
        return len(self.names) # we just return the length of the internal list
        # we do this so that we can just call
        #   person = Person()
        #   num_people = len(person) - this will invoke the __len__ method
        # for more concise and encapsulated code

    def __iter__(self):  # to initialize the iterator, use __iter__ and just return the class itself
        return self

    def __next__(self):  # for __next__, return the next desired variable when the next item is requested e.g through a for loop or the next() method.
                         # raise StopIteration exception to signify that iteration should stop maybe because items are exhausted
        if self.idx == len(self.names):
            self.idx = 0
            raise StopIteration

        self.idx += 1
        return self.names[self.idx - 1]


person = Person()
person.add_name("vaught")
person.add_name("liss")
person.add_name("papiyier")
person.add_name("denda")
person.add_name("oliec")

# can create a list out of the iterator in Person
nm_list = list(person)
print(nm_list)

# utilizing the iterator
Use the iter() method to get the iterator representation of your class and prepare for iterations.
It is preferred to use the iter() method to get the iterator in this custom iterator situation, though you can just iterate through it
without getting the iterator representation

    itrtr = iter(person)
    foo = next(itrtr)

for name in iter(person):
    print(name * 2)

# can even use next() method with the custom iterator
iteratr = iter(person)
print("next:", next(iteratr))
print("next:", next(iteratr))
print("next:", next(iteratr))

nm_list = list(iteratr)
print(nm_list)

Basically, any iterable can be converted to a list, including a generator.
A generator remembers the index of the last item that was accessed. When you invoke a for loop, or convert the generator to a list, it will compile elements from where it left off.
E.g:
gen = (i**2 for i in range(1,10))
geni = iter(gen)

print(next(geni))
print(next(geni))

for j in geni:
    print(j, end=' ')

print()

print(list(gen))

Outputs:
1
4
9 16 25 36 49 64 81
[]


ADDING ITEMS TO A PYTHON LIST WHILE SORTING IT AT THE SAME TIME
Use the inbuilt bisect module

import bisect

persons: list[Person] = []

def user_key(person: Person):
    return person.age # this will sort it in ascending order
                      # to sort in descending order, negate the value (return -person.age instead)
                      # the key specifies which field you want to use for sorting. it is function that returns a value

bisect.insort(persons, Person('foo', 'male', 45), key=user_key)
bisect.insort(persons, Person('bar', 'female', 24), key=user_key)
bisect.insort(persons, Person('baz', 'male', 39), key=user_key)
bisect.insort(persons, Person('choo', 'male', 67), key=user_key)
bisect.insort(persons, Person('zoo', 'female', 14), key=user_key)
bisect.insort(persons, Person('loo', 'male', 21), key=user_key)
bisect.insort(persons, Person('moo', 'female', 89), key=user_key)
bisect.insort(persons, Person('var', 'male', 33), key=user_key)
bisect.insort(persons, Person('char', 'male', 31), key=user_key)
bisect.insort(persons, Person('lar', 'male', 6), key=user_key)

You can use the argument 'key' to specify the field in your class that will be used for sorting (that's if you're using
classes. we wouldn't have to do this if we were just sorting plain numbers for example)

Calling bisect.insort will add the item to the list while sorting it at the same time.
